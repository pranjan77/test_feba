	show all => showAll=1 option
	show nearby => genesFit.cgi with around
	sequence  => getSeq.cgi
	check homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	cofitness => cofit.cgi
myFitShow.cgi -- show list of matching genes, or forward to singleFit.cgi for a single gene
	each gene => singleFit.cgi, org => org.cgi
orthFit.cgi -- for a gene in a condition, show table of fitness across orthologs
	each gene => showFit.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	show all homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi
genesFit.cgi -- show fitness of multiple genes
	each individual gene => myFitShow.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
        fitness cell => strainTable.cgi
	add or remove genes => locusId or addgene options
	show all => showAll=1 option
cofit.cgi -- top cofit hits for a gene
	each hit => myFitShow.cgi or compareGenes.cgi
	checkboxes => genesFit.cgi
	fitness data (for query gene) => myFitShow.cgi
	homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
compareGenes.cgi => geneOverview.cgi for each gene,
	exp.cgi for selected experiments (in table),
	genesFit.cgi (of the same two genes)
	=> itself (change which comparison to show)
	=> itself to select which of multiple matching genes to compare to
        in dynamic table, fitness values => strainTable.cgi
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
	also each organism links to org.cgi
# experiment-wise pages
exps.cgi -- matching experiments => exp.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi (if a condition query was made)
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show metrics, or top genes
	if showing specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes
		each gene => myFitShow.cgi, each cell => orthFit.cgi
	compare to => compareExps.cgi
	across all organisms => orthCond.cgi
compareExps.cgi -- interactive scatterplot to compare two experiments
	links to exp.cgi
	link to itself to change which experiments to show
	can interactively or programmatically build a gene table
		link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or genesFit.cgi for multi-gene heatmap
        in dynamic table, fitness values => strainTable.cgi
# condition-wise pages
cond.cgi -- list all conditions in a group
	links to exps.cgi and orthCond.cgi for each condition
orthCond.cgi -- specific sick genes for a condition across all organisms
	link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or exp.cgi per experiment
	link to orthFit.cgi to compare a cell
