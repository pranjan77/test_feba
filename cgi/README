See SETUP for instructions on the files and perl utilities that are
required for this to work. The key directories are:
cgi/ -- CGI scripts
cgi_data/ -- sqlite3 database and BLAST database
tmp/ -- temporary files
lib/Utils.pm -- shared functions

Site map:

myFrontPage.cgi -- the front page
	search by name => myFitShow.cgi
	search by sequence => mySeqSearch.cgi
myFitShow.cgi -- show list of matching genes, or table of fitness data for one gene
	if a list, links to page for individual gene
	if showing table of fitness data:
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	each cell => orthFit.cgi
	add a gene => genesFit.cgi
	show all => showAll=1 option
	show nearby => genesFit.cgi with around
	sequence  => getSeq.cgi
	check homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
	cofitness => cofit.cgi
orthFit.cgi -- for a gene in a condition, show table of fitness across orthologs
	each gene => showFit.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	show all homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
genesFit.cgi -- show fitness of multiple genes
	each individual gene => myFitShow.cgi
	each experiment => exp.cgi
	add or remove genes => locusId or addgene options
	show all => showAll=1 option
cofit.cgi -- top cofit hits for a gene
	each hit => myFitShow.cgi
	checkboxes => genesFit.cgi
	fitness data (for query gene) => myFitShow.cgi
	homologs => mySeqSearch.cgi
mySeqSearch.cgi -- a list of hits, linking to myFitShow.cgi for each (if it has data)
getSeq.cgi -- sequence of gene (if it is a protein)
exp.cgi -- for an experiment, show metrics, or top genes
	if showing specific phenotypes, or important genes, or detrimental genes
		each gene => myFitShow.cgi, each cell => orthFit.cgi
	compare to => compareExps.cgi
compareExps.cgi -- interactive scatterplot to compare two experiments
	links to exp.cgi
	link to itself to change which experiments to show
	can interactively or programmatically build a gene table
		link to myFitShow.cgi per gene or genesFit.cgi for multi-gene heatmap

And every page ends with a link to the front page
