Only the cgi scripts are in the code respository. These other files
will need to be set up for the web site to work.  (All paths are
within the main feba/ directory of the repository)

A SQL database using mysqlite, which is in
	cgi_data/feba.db
Its schema is described in lib/db_setup_tables.sql
It can built from the HTML directories that are created by BarSeqR.pl
by using bin/db_setup.pl

BLAST executables (blastall, fastacmd, formatdb), which should be in
	bin/blast/
(or this can be a symlink to a location where they are available)

A BLAST database of amino acid sequences, with identifiers of the form orgId:locusId (i.e., "Keio:14146"), in
	cgi_data/aaseqs
It must be formatted with
	bin/blast/formatdb -o T -p T -i cgi_data/aaseqs

Some of the scripts also write temporary files to
	tmp/
This directory will need to be writable by the web server, i.e.,
	chmod a+w tmp

The other dependencies are perl modules:
	CGI
	DBI
	List::Util;
	Time::HiRes (for making unique file names)
	Bio::SeqIO (used to read FASTA files; could be replaced)

The front page for the web site is:
	cgi/myFrontPage.cgi

If setting up fitness blast -- see images/fitblast_example.html,
cgi/seqservice.cgi, and bin/start_ublast_service.pl. You'll need to
create bin/usearch6. Also, images/fitblast.js uses URLs of the form
server_root/cgi-bin/, not server_root/cgi/. You may need to set up
cgi-bin as a symbolic link for it to work, i.e. in the feba directory,
	ln -s cgi cgi-bin
