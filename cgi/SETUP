Only the cgi scripts are in the code respository. These other files
will need to be set up for the web site to work.  (All paths are
within the main feba/ directory of the repository)

A SQL database using mysqlite, which is in
	cgi_data/feba.db
Its schema is described in lib/db_setup_tables.sql
It can built from the HTML directories that are created by BarSeqR.pl
by using bin/db_setup.pl

BLAST executables (blastall, fastacmd, formatdb), which should be in
	bin/blast/
(or this can be a symlink to a location where they are available)

A BLAST database of amino acid sequences, which is in
	cgi_data/aaseqs
and must be formatted with
	bin/formatdb -o T -p T -i cgi_data/aaseqs

Some of the scripts also write temporary files to
	tmp/
This directory will need to be writable by the web server, i.e.,
	chmod a+w tmp

The other dependencies are perl modules:
	CGI
	DBI
	List::Util;
	Time::HiRes (for making unique file names)
	Bio::SeqIO (used to read FASTA files)

The front page for the web site is:
	cgi/myFrontPage.cgi
