Scripts for Estimating Mutant Fitness By Sequencing Randomly Barcoded
Transposons (RB-TnSeq)

This code repository (bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/feba/) includes
scripts for estimating mutant fitness by sequencing randomly barcoded
transposons (RB-TnSeq). The stages in creating fitness estimates are:

Processing TnSeq data with MapTnSeq.pl and DesignRandomPool.pl

Processing BarSeq data with MultiCodes.pl, combineBarSeq.pl, and
BarSeqR.pl.

MapTnSeq.pl identifies the random barcode, the junction between the
transposon and the genome, and maps the remainder of the read to the
genome. The result is a list of mapped reads with their barcodes and
insertion locations.

DesignRandomPool.pl uses the output of MapTnSeq.pl to identify
barcodes that consistently map to a unique location in the
genome. These are the useful barcodes. It also reports various metrics
about the pool of mutants. (This step is done by invoking
PoolStats.R.)  Ideally, a mutant library has even insertions across
the genome; has insertions in most of the protein-coding genes (except
the essential ones); has a similar number of reads for insertions in
most genes (i.e., no crazy positive selection for loss of a few
genes); has insertions on both strands of genes (insertions on only
one strand may indicate that the resistance marker's promoter is too
weak); has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of useful
barcodes; and the useful barcode s account for most of the reads.

MultiCodes.pl identifies the barcode in each read and makes a table of
how often it saw each barcode. It can also demultiplex reads if using
the older primers with inline demultiplexing and no separate index
read.

combineBarSeq.pl merges the table of counts from MultiCodes.pl with
the pool definition from DesignRandomPool.pl to make a table of how
often each strain was seen.

BarSeqR.pl combines multiple lanes of barseq output with the genes
table to make a single large table, and then uses the R code in FEBA.R
to estimate the fitness of each gene in each experiment. It produces a
mini web site with data tables and quality assessment plots. It
requires metadata about the experiments (usually FEBA_BarSeq.tsv) and
information about the GC content of each gene (genes.GC -- this can be
produced from a normal genes table with RegionGC.pl).

BarSeqTest.pl is a wrapper to analyze barseq reads and run
BarSeqR.pl. It is intended for small test runs and does not require a
metadata table.

There are also helper scripts RunTnSeqLocal.pl and RunBarSeqLocal.pl
for analyzing the reads in parallel. Both of these scripts use
submitter.pl to issue jobs in parallel, and its behavior can be
modified by setting environment variables (see top of submitter.pl).

RunTnSeqLocal.pl processes a TnSeq run in parallel by running
MapTnSeq.pl on each part separately and then running
DesignRandomPool.pl. This script assumes that there is a g/nickname
directory for your organism that includes the genome sequence
(genome.fna) and a tab-delimited table of genes (genes.tab).

RunBarSeqLocal.pl processes a large BarSeq run in parallel by running
MultiCodes.pl on each piece separately and then running
combineBarSeq.pl to combine the results.

web sites at

This is research software that has undergone limited testing. Be careful.
